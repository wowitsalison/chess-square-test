# chess-square-test
A small app to practice chess board vision by quizzing which color each coordinate is

To create a desktop shortcut I created `squarequiz.desktop` on my desktop and wrote this:
```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Square Quiz
Path=/home/username/Projects/chess-square-test
Exec=python3 frontend.py
Terminal=false
Type=Application
```
and made it executable as a program.
